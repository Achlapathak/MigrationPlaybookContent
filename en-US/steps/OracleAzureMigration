<!--Migrate-->

### Overview

After deploying your schema, the next step is to execute the data migration to Azure SQL Database. The recommended tool for data movement workflow is Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).

### Process

1.For data migration, use Azure DMS to create a new Migration project and follow the wizard to execute data migration.

_Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) designed to streamline the process of migrating on premises databases to Azure. Using DMS will simplify the migration of existing on-premises SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL databases to Azure SQL Database or Microsoft SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine. The automated workflow, with assessment reporting, guides the user through the changes that are required prior to performing the actual migration. When the modifications are in place and the customer is prepared, 
the service will migrate their database to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server in Azure._

### Near zero downtime migrations with Attunity Replicate!

Microsoft has partnered with Attunity around specific migration scenarios (source/target pairs). Attunity Replicate supports a very large set of sources and targets. The SKU of Attunity Replicate that we refer to in the context of this partnership is known as Attunity Replicate For Microsoft Migration (this is an Attunity product and not a Microsoft product) and enables only the scenarios for which we are partnering for now. 

Attunity Replicate is a data replication tool that enables data sync between a variety of sources and targets. In this context, 
Attunity Replicate propagates the table creation script. It will not propagate any other artifacts (SP, triggers, functions, â€¦.) 
and will not convert say PL/SQL code hosted in artifacts like functions/SP/triggers to T-SQL. 

With Attunity Replicate, you can do the following:
1.	Convert the source Oracle database to Azure SQL database with tools like SSMA and Azure Database Migration Service or any other third party tool depending on your preferences and/or the supported endpoints of these tools.
2.	For those who would need to keep replicating data from your source database to target database for a while, after above step, you would use Attunity Replicate i.e. near zero downtime migration, related to amount of time you need to prevent write to your source database, drain the source/replicate to target, point the applications from source database to target database.
