<!-- Assess -->

When the data sources have been identified, the next step is to assess on-premises SQL Server instance(s) migrating to Azure SQL database(s) to understand the gaps between the source and target instances. By using Data Migration Assistant (DMA), you can assess your source database before migrating to Azure SQL Database target.

### Steps

To use DMA to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download [DMA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595)**, and then install it.

2. Create a **New Assessment** project

    a. Click on the New icon and select “Assessment” project type. Select "SQL Server" as source and "Azure SQL Database" as target types. Click "Create"

    c. Choose one or both from the following assessment report types - Compatibility Issues; Feature Parity. Click "Next"

    d. Click on "Add Sources" to open the connection fly-out
    
    e. Provide the Azure SQL instance name to connect to and select databases you want to assess
                
    ![Add databases](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/dmaadddb.bmp)   
    
    Note: Now wait for the assessment results. Assessment duration depends on the number of databases added and the schema size of each database. Results will be displayed per database as soon as they are available.
         
    f. Check "Compatibility Issues" radio button to review incompatible objects categorized under “Migration Blockers”, “Behavior changes” and “Deprecated features

    g. Check "Feature Parity" radio button to review features "Unspported" or "Partially Supported" in Azure SQL Database

3. **Review Assessment Results**

    a. Once all databases completed assessments, click on "Export report" to export the results to either JSON or CSV file for analyzing the data at your own convenience
