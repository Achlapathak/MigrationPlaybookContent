<!-- Assessment -->

**Overview**

After the data sources are identified, each data source needs to be scanned to identify any discrepancies between the source and the target. These discrepancies can include potential compatibility issues, feature parity, incompatible source schema, etc. For example, when migrating from a SQL Server 2005 on-premises instance to Azure SQL Database, we need to identify all the features that are not supported in Azure SQL Database such as SQL Agent jobs, or unsupported syntax such as non-ANSI style joins.
You can use SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) to assess the database, discover conversion rate, and resolve any issues.

Note: For more information about SSMA, see the article [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (OracleToSQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/oracle/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-oracle-oracletosql).

**Process**

To use SSMA for Oracle to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1.Download SSMA from the Microsoft Download Center here, and then install it.

_SSMA is now ready for use._

2.Assess the source database and discover conversion rate and effort to resolve issues.

_This will generate an HTML report with conversion statistics and error/ warnings. Be sure to analyze this report to understand any conversion issues and their cause. Then address the issues before continuing to the next step._

3.Perform schema conversion.

_With the schema conversion is complete, you are ready to move on to the Migration phase._
