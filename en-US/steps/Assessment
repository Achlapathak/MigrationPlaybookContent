Once you define the requirements of the migration project, it is important to assess the environment. Here are some of the questions for consideration:

* What is the scope of the project?
* Inventory the current system
* Application stack discovery (Database & application)
* Impact analysis

There are two phases to assessment - Discover and Uncover

**Discover**: You will be able to get a detailed reporting on the scope for server and storage consolidations, migrations and upgrade; hardware information. 

You can use Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) toolkit for SQL Server to securely assess your environment for your migration.

Note: If you already have a good knowledge of the inventory, please proceed to Step 2 - Uncover.

**Uncover**: This step will allow you to assess individual databases in your inventory and provides
you a HTML report with conversion statistics and errors/warnings that need to be resolved.

You can use SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) to assess the database, discover conversation rate and resolve any issues.
