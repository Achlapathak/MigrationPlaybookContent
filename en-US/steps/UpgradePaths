The following destinations of data migration are included:
•	SQL Server 2014
•	SQL Server 2016
•	Azure SQL DB (as of June 2017 the internal database engine runs at SQL Server 2017 level)
The following data migration options are discussed:
•	Backup and restore
•	Transactional replication
•	Always On Availability Group
•	Data Migration Service and Data Migration Assistant (DMS and DMA)
