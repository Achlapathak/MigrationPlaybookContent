<!-- Assess & Convert -->

**Overview**

By using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for MySQL, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to Azure SQL Databaser, and then migrate data to Azure SQL Database.

Note: For more information about SSMA, see the article [SQL Server Migration Assistant for MySQL (MySQLToSQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/mysql/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-mysql-mysqltosql).

**Process**

To use SSMA for MySQL to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1.Download SSMA from the Microsoft Download Center [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54257), and then install it.

_SSMA is now ready for use._

2.Assess the source database and discover conversion rate and effort to resolve issues. For more information about SSMA for MySQL Assessments, see the article [Assessing MySQL Databases for Conversion (MySQLToSQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/mysql/assessing-mysql-databases-for-conversion-mysqltosql).

_This will generate an HTassessment ML report with conversion statistics and error/ warnings. Be sure to analyze this report to understand any conversion issues and their cause. Then address the issues before continuing to the next step._

3.Perform conversion. For more information about SSMA for MySQL Conversion, see the article [Converting MySQL Databases (MySQLToSQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/mysql/converting-mysql-databases-mysqltosql).

_When the schema conversion is complete, you are ready to move on to the Migration phase._
