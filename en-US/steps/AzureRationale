SQL Database is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud based on the market-leading Microsoft SQL Server engine and capable of handling mission-critical workloads. SQL Database delivers predictable performance at multiple service levels, dynamic scalability with no downtime, built-in business continuity, and data protection â€” all with near-zero administration.

These capabilities allow you to focus on rapid app development and accelerating your time-to-market, rather than allocating precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure. Because SQL Database is based on the [SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb545450.aspx) engine, SQL Database supports existing SQL Server tools, libraries, and APIs. This makes it is easy for you to develop new solutions, to move your existing SQL Server solutions, and to extend your existing SQL Server solutions to the Microsoft cloud without having to learn new skills.

If you are concerned about being able to **adjust performance and scale without downtime**:

The SQL Database service offers three [service tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers) (Basic, Standard, Premium, and Premium RS), and each tier offers different levels of performance and capabilities to support lightweight to heavyweight database workloads. You can change tiers manually or programmatically at any time to meet the needs of your solution, and you can do this without downtime to your app or to your customers. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements and lets you pay for the resources you need when you need them.
