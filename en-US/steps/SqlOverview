<!--Migration Process Overview-->

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project â€“ a  solid methodology is required for success. When planning a migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic:

Each phase in the database migration process is briefly described in the following table:

|**Stage** |**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------|:---------------|
|Pre-migration | Discover | Inventory database assets, and application stack discovery. |
|Pre-migration | Assess | Assess workloads and fix recommendations. |
|Pre-migration | Convert* | For heterogeneous migrations, convert the source schema to work in the target environment. |
|Migration | Migrate schema, data, and objects | Migrate the source schema, and then migrate the source data to the target. |
|Migration | Sync data* | For minimal downtime migrations, sync your target schema and data with the source. |
|Migration | Cutover* | For minimal downtime migrations, cut over from the source to the target environment. |
|Post-migration | Remediate applications | Iteratively make any necessary changes to your applications. |
|Post-migration | Perform Tests | Iteratively run functional and performance tests. |
|Post-migration | Optimize | Based on the tests you performed, address any performance issues, and then retest to confirm the performance improvements. |
