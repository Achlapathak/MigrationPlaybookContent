<!-- Overview -->

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project. A methodology is required for success. We have these 5-step process we recommend for migration projects.

Each phase in the process is briefly described in the following table:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Discover | Discover requirements, success, risks for your migration project. |
|Assess | Assessment	Inventory of your current database assets and application stack discovery. |
|Migrate Schema | Convert/Migrate Schema	Source schema needs to be converted to work in target. |
|Migrate Data | Migration of data to target. |
|Data Sync | Data Sync	Data and schema sync post migration. |
|Remediate Applications | Perform validations to ensure applications work on target platform. |
|Optimization | Post data and schema migration, the target needs to be tested to identify functional and perf issues. |
|Cutover | Rollback plan ready. |
