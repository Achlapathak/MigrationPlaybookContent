<!--Rationale for Migrating-->

Microsoft SQL Server 2017 powers your entire data estate by supporting structured and unstructured data sources. 
It builds on the previous versions of SQL Server, which have been industry leading for four years in a row and a leader in TPC-E. 
It scales to petabytes of data and allows processing of big data through Polybase using T-SQL over any data. 
SQL Server has also been the least vulnerable database during the last seven years. 

Consider the detail in the following sections when evaluating the rationale for migrating.

**Security**

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) public security board, SQL Server has the 
lowest number of reported security vulnerabilities across the major database vendors (NSIT, 2016).

**Performance**

SQL Server owns the top TPC-E performance benchmarks for transaction processing, the top TPC-H performance benchmarks for data 
warehousing, and the top performance benchmarks with leading business applications. In April 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
published a new TPC-H 1TB world record with SQL Server 2017 running on Linux.

**Total cost of ownership**

SQL Server has a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than similar enterprise data solutions. In some cases, the TCO of 
SQL Server 2016 was found to be as low as 1/12th the cost of comparable products/features. The TCO analysis tool can help to determine the real difference in cost between a current Oracle solution and SQL Server. 
The TCO Calculator provides a custom report showing the specific cost savings and benefits a customer can anticipate by migrating 
from Oracle to SQL Server.

**The power of SQL Server now on Linux and containers**

SQL Server 2017 offers the best performance and security features, and they are now available on all supported platforms, 
including Windows, Linux, and containers. High-performance features bring record-breaking speed to data-driven applications. 
These features include columnstore (which provides column-based data storage and processing to achieve up to 10 times the query 
performance and data compression of row-based storage) and in-memory OLTP (which brings transaction processing to memory-optimized 
tables at more than 2.5 times the speed of disk-based tables). Security features like Auditing, Transparent Data Encryption, 
Row-Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking and Always Encrypted provide server-side security measures that vastly simplify the process 
for keeping data safe from unauthorized access, without the need to modify existing client applications. Auditing enables teams to 
monitor access and track potentially suspicious activity. Transparent Data Encryption protects data at rest at a file level, 
while Always Encrypted secures data in motion and at rest. With these capabilities available on all SQL Server editions, 
organizations can choose their deployment environment by operational need, as opposed to desired features. 

**Adaptive Query Processing feature family**

New in SQL Server 2017, Adaptive Query Processing introduces new capabilities that allow the SQL Server query processor to modify 
plan choices based on runtime characteristics. During query processing and optimization, the cardinality estimation (CE) 
process is responsible for estimating the number of rows processed at each step in an execution plan. 
Inaccurate estimates can cause slow query response time, excessive resource utilization (CPU, Memory, IO), and reduced throughput 
and concurrency. To improve CE techniques, SQL Server 2017 introduces a new feature family: adaptive query processing (AQP). 
AQP improves the handling of the more intractable CE issues. 

**Automatic plan correction**

New features in SQL Server 2017 detect plan choice regressions and give recommendations on how to fix the problem. 
These automatic plan correction features help to maintain the performance of data queries, even when application changes occur. 

**SQL Graph**

Customers need to do more than just manage large volumes of data. They also need to analyze their existing data more effectively to 
understand its relationships and patterns. Querying data from a relational schema by using traditional SQL queries can be made easier. SQL Server 2017 introduces SQL Graph to make modeling and analyzing relationships easier by allowing users to handle the 
relationships in a more flexible and agile way. 

**Resumable Online Index Rebuild**

Planning, maintaining, and managing a large index online can be challenging. The bigger the index, the more difficult index maintenance 
becomes. Reorganizing and rebuilding indexes can be especially cumbersome. Resumable Online Index Rebuild in SQL Server 2017 enables 
continuation of an online index rebuild operation after a failure (such as a failover to a replica or insufficient disk space). 
Resumable Online Index Rebuild also enables pausing and later resuming an online index rebuild operation. 
For example, you might need to temporarily free up system resources to execute a high-priority task, or complete the index rebuild at 
another time if the available maintenance window is too short for a large table. Finally, Resumable Online Index Rebuild does not 
require significant log space, which allows you to perform log truncation while the resumable rebuild operation is running. 

**In-Memory OLTP enhancements in SQL Server 2017**

A feature since SQL Server 2014, In-memory technology for SQL Server dramatically improves the throughput and latency of SQL Server 
OLTP capabilities. It is designed to meet the requirements of the most demanding transaction processing applications, and Microsoft 
has worked closely with several companies to prove these gains. SQL Server 2017 adds features to improve the performance and 
supportability of In-Memory OLTP workloads. In addition, many limitations on tables and stored procedures have been removed 
to make it easier to migrate your applications and take advantage of the benefits of In-Memory OLTP.
