<!--Rationale for Migrating-->

Microsoft SQL Server 2017 powers your entire data estate by supporting structured and unstructured data sources. 
It builds on the previous versions of SQL Server, which have been industry leading for four years in a row and a leader in TPC-E. 
It scales to petabytes of data and allows processing of big data through Polybase using T-SQL over any data. 
SQL Server has also been the least vulnerable database during the last seven years. 

Consider the detail in the following sections when evaluating the rationale for migrating.

**Security**

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) public security board, SQL Server has the 
lowest number of reported security vulnerabilities across the major database vendors (NSIT, 2016).

**Performance**

SQL Server owns the top TPC-E performance benchmarks for transaction processing, the top TPC-H performance benchmarks for data 
warehousing, and the top performance benchmarks with leading business applications. In April 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
published a new TPC-H 1TB world record with SQL Server 2017 running on Linux.

**Total cost of ownership**

SQL Server has a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than similar enterprise data solutions. In some cases, the TCO of 
SQL Server 2016 was found to be as low as 1/12th the cost of comparable products/features.

The TCO analysis tool can help to determine the real difference in cost between a current Oracle solution and SQL Server. 
The TCO Calculator provides a custom report showing the specific cost savings and benefits a customer can anticipate by migrating 
from Oracle to SQL Server.

**The power of SQL Server now on Linux and containers**

SQL Server 2017 offers the best performance and security features, and theyâ€™re now available on all supported platforms, 
including Windows, Linux, and containers. High-performance features bring record-breaking speed to data-driven applications. 
These features include columnstore (which provides column-based data storage and processing to achieve up to 10 times the query 
performance and data compression of row-based storage) and 

**In-Memory OLTP enhancements in SQL Server 2017**

A feature since SQL Server 2014, In-memory technology for SQL Server dramatically improves the throughput and latency of SQL Server 
OLTP capabilities. It is designed to meet the requirements of the most demanding transaction processing applications, and Microsoft 
has worked closely with several companies to prove these gains. SQL Server 2017 adds features to improve the performance and 
supportability of In-Memory OLTP workloads. In addition, many limitations on tables and stored procedures have been removed 
to make it easier to migrate your applications and take advantage of the benefits of In-Memory OLTP.
