<!--Migrate-->

### Overview

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps – publishing the schema and migrating the data. SSMA for Oracle is the correct tool to use for this process.

### Process

To use SSMA for Oracle to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1.Publish the schema to SQL Server.

_This action will publish the Oracle schema to the SQL Server instance._

2.Migrate data to SQL Server.

_After the migration is complete you will be able to view the “Data Migration report”._

**Important**: SSMA does not support migration of all Oracle features. For associated workarounds, see the following resource:

* [Migration approach for selected Oracle features](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2017/05/10/migration-approach-for-oracle-features/)

 SSMA is not the only option for migrating data, though. You could also use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

**Note**: For complete step-by-step guidance on publishing the schema and migrating the data, see the following resource:

### Near zero downtime migrations with Attunity Replicate!

Microsoft has partnered with Attunity around specific migration scenarios (source/target pairs). Attunity Replicate supports a very large set of sources and targets. The SKU of Attunity Replicate that we refer to in the context of this partnership is known as Attunity Replicate For Microsoft Migration (this is an Attunity product and not a Microsoft product) and enables only the scenarios for which we are partnering for now. 

Attunity Replicate is a data replication tool that enables data sync between a variety of sources and targets. In this context, 
Attunity Replicate at best propagates the table creation script. It will not propagate any other artifacts (SP, triggers, functions, ….) 
and will not convert say PL/SQL code hosted in artifacts like functions/SP/triggers to T-SQL. 

With Attunity Replicate, you can do the following:
1.	Convert the source Oracle database to SQL Server database with tools like SSMA and Azure Database Migration Service or any other third party tool depending on your preferences and/or the supported endpoints of these tools.
2.	For those who would need to keep replicating data from your source database to target database target for a while, after above step, you would use Attunity Replicate i.e. near zero downtime migration, related to amount of time you need to prevent write to your source database, drain the source/replicate to target, point the applications from source database to target database.
