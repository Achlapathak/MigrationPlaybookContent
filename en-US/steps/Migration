<!--Migrate-->

**Overview**

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps – publishing the schema and migrating the data. SSMA for Oracle is the correct tool to use for this process.

**Process**

To use SSMA for Oracle to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1.Publish the schema to SQL Server.

_This action will publish the Oracle schema to the SQL Server instance._

2.Migrate data to SQL Server.

_After the migration is complete you will be able to view the “Data Migration report”._

**Important**: SSMA does not support migration of all Oracle features. For associated workarounds, see the following resource:

* [Migration approach for selected Oracle features](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2017/05/10/migration-approach-for-oracle-features/)

 SSMA is not the only option for migrating data, though. You could also use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
