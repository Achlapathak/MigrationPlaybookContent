<!--Migration-->

Once you are done with assessing your databases, the next
step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps - schema
migration and data migration. 

You can use **SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)** to accomplish the above steps. 

Learn more about [SSMA Assessments](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssma/). 

Download the **SSMA** from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258).

By using SSMA for Oracle, you can do the following:
  * Review database objects and data.
  * Assess databases for migration.
  * Migrate Oracle databases to SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
