After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps â€“ publishing the schema and migrating the data. SSMA for DB2 is the correct tool to use for this process.

**Process**

To use SSMA for DB2 to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1.Setting migration options

_Review the project migration otpions in the Project Settings dialog._

2.Migrate data to Azure SQL Database.

_After the migration is complete you will be able to view the migration report._
