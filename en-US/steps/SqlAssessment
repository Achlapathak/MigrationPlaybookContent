<!-- Assess -->

When the data sources have been identified, each of them needs to be scanned to identify gaps between source and target. This includes identifying compatibility issues, breaking changes and behavior changes between the two versions. As an example, for upgrading from SQL Server 2008 to the latest SQL Server, we need to identify all the breaking changes or unsupported syntax such as non-ANSI style joins that will likely block migrations.
By using Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the database, you can identify potential upgrade blockers, and resolve any issues.

### Process

To use DMA to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download [DMA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595)**, and then install it.

2. Create a **new Assessment** project

    a. Click on the New icon and select “Assessment” project type. Select "SQL Server" as source and target types. Click "Create"
    
    ![New Assessment](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/dmanewproject.bmp)    
    
    b. Select the target SQL Server version that you plan to migrate to, and need to run assessment against
    
    c. Choose one or both from the following assessment report types - Compatibility Issues; New features’ recommendation. Click "Next"
    
    ![Report Types](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/dmaassessment.bmp)   
    
    d. Click on "Add Sources" to open the connection fly-out
        
        *Enter SQL server instance name, choose Authentication type and set the correct connection properties
       
        *Click "Connect"
        
        *Select the databases you want to assess and click "Add"
        
        *Click "Next"
        
    ![Add databases](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/dmaadddb.bmp)   
    
    e. Now wait for the assessment results. Assessment duration depends on the number of databases added and the schema size of each database. Results will be displayed per database as soon as they are available.
    
    f. Select the database that has completed assessment. Switch between "Compatibility issues" and "Feature recommendations" using the switcher
    
    ![Assessment results](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/dmaassessmentresults.bmp)  
    
    g. Compatibility Issues can be reviewed by analyzing the impacted object and its details for every issue identified under “Breaking changes”, “Behavior changes” and “Deprecated features
    
    h. Similarly, you can review features’ recommendation across “Performance”, “Storage” and “Security” areas. Feature recommendations cover a variety of features such as In-Memory OLTP and Columnstore, Stretch Database, Always Encrypted (AE), Dynamic Data Masking (DDM), and Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
