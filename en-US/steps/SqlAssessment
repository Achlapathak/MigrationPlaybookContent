<!-- Assess -->

When the data sources have been identified, each of them needs to be scanned to identify gaps between source and target. This includes identifying compatibility issues, breaking changes and behavior changes between the two versions. As an example, for upgrading from SQL Server 2008 to the latest SQL Server, we need to identify all the breaking changes or unsupported syntax such as non-ANSI style joins that will likely block migrations.
By using Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the database, you can identify potential upgrade blockers, and resolve any issues.

### Process

To use DMA to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download DMA** [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595), and then install it.


2. **Run Assessment workflow**
