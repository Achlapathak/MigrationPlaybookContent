<!-- Assess & Convert -->

**Overview**

By using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, and then migrate data to Azure SQL Database.

Note: For more information about SSMA, see the article [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (OracleToSQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/oracle/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-oracle-oracletosql).

**Process**

To use SSMA for Oracle to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1.Download SSMA from the Microsoft Download Center [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258), and then install it.

_SSMA is now ready for use._

2.Assess the source database and discover conversion rate and effort to resolve issues.

_This will generate an HTML report with conversion statistics and error/ warnings. Be sure to analyze this report to understand any conversion issues and their cause. Then address the issues before continuing to the next step._

3.Perform schema conversion.

_With the schema conversion is complete, you are ready to move on to the Migration phase._
