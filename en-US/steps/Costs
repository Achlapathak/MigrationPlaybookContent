<!-- Costs -->

SQL Server 2016 delivers 11.7X better TCO than a comparable Oracle solution. And
these are annualized cost savings!

More importantly, with Oracle, it is not what you are paying
for now, but what you will pay in the future. As you take advantage of more
capabilities, you’ve got to fork out additional money….

With SQL Server 2016, developments in in-memory, advanced analytics, and mobile BI are all
built-into the product; no need for any additional investment.
