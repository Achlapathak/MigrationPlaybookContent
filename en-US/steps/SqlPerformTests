<!--Perform Tests-->

**Overview**

Once the data is migrated to target, perform tests against the databases to understand that the applications are expected to perform well against the after the migration.
For this, use Data Experimentation Assistant (DEA) to assist with evaluating the target SQL Server. 

Note: For more information about DEA, see the article [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2016/10/24/database-experimentation-assistant-v1-0-preview/).

**Process**

To use DEA for database migration testing, perform the following steps.

1.Download DEA from the Microsoft Download Center here, and then install it.

_DEA is now ready for use._

2.Run a trace capture using DEA.

_This workflow will give the ability to automatically capture a production workload trace on source SQL Server with only a few inputs._

3.Run a trace replay using DEA.

_This workflow will give the ability to replay a source trace captured on a target SQL Server._

4.Create new analysis report.

_This workflow will give the ability to generate new reports which provide insight into how workload performance changes across versions of SQL._
