<!--Perform Tests-->

Once the data is migrated to target, perform tests against the databases to understand that the applications are expected to perform well against the after the migration.
For this, use Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) to assist with evaluating the target SQL Server. 

### Process

To use DEA for database migration testing, perform the following steps.

1. **Download the [DEA tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54090)**, and then install it.

2. **Run a trace capture**

    a. Go to "All Captures" by clicking on the camera icon on the left navigation
    
    b. Provide necessary inputs to begin capture - trace name, duration, SQL Server instance name, database name, share location to store source trace file on SQL Server machine
    
    c. "Start" to begin trace capture

3. **Run a trace replay**



4.Create new analysis report.

_This workflow will give the ability to generate new reports which provide insight into how workload performance changes across versions of SQL._
