<!--Perform Tests-->

Once the data is migrated to target, perform tests against the databases to understand that the applications are expected to perform well against the after the migration.
For this, use Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) to assist with evaluating the target SQL Server. 

### Steps

To use DEA for database migration testing, perform the following steps.

1. **Download the [DEA tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54090)**, and then install it.

2. **Run a trace capture**

    a. Go to "All Captures" by clicking on the camera icon on the left navigation.
    
    b. To start a new capture, click on "New Capture".
    
    c. Provide necessary inputs to begin capture - trace name, duration, SQL Server instance name, database name, share location to store source trace file on SQL Server machine.
    
    d. "Start" to begin trace capture.

3. **Run a trace replay**
    
    a. Go to "All Replays" by clicking on the play icon on the left navigation.
    
    b. To start a new replay, click on “New Replay”.
    
    c. Provide necessary inputs for replay - Replay name, Controller machine name, Path to source trace file on controller, SQL Server instance name, Path to store target trace file on SQL Server machine.
    
    d. "Start" to begin replay of your capture.
    
 4. **Create New Analysis Report**
 
    a. Go to "Analysis Reports" on the left navigation. 
    
    b. Connect to the SQL Server where you will store your report databases. You will see the list of all reports in the server.
    
    c. Click on "New Report".
    
    d. Provide necessary inputs to generate report - Reprot name, traces from source and target SQL Server instances.
    
 5. **Review Analysis Report**
 
    a. On the first page of your report, you will see the version and build information for the target servers on which the experiment was run. . Threshold allows you to adjust the sensitivity or tolerance of your A/B Test analysis. By default, it is set at 5%; any improvement in performance that is >= 5% is categorized as ‘Improved’.  The dropdown allows you to evaluate the report with different performance thresholds.
