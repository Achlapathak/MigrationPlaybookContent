<!--Process Overview-->
Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project. A methodology is required for
success. We have these 5 step process we recommend for migration projects. 

![Migration Process](http://www.cleanrecords.com/mpb/images/OverallMigrationProcess.png)

Each phase in the process is briefly described as below:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Define | Requirements, success and risks for your migration project. |
|Assess | Inventory of your current database assets and application stack discovery. |
|Design | Design to land the migration, plan to expand. |
|Migrate/Test/Remediate     | Schema and data migration; perform validations. |
|Deploy | Deployment workflow to production. |
