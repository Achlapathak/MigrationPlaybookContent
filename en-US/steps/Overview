<!--Process Overview-->
Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project â€“ a  solid methodology is required for success. When planning a migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic:

Each phase in the process is briefly described as below:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Discover | Inventory of your current database assets and application stack discovery.|
|Assess & Convert | Assess workloads and fix recommendations; schema conversion. |
|Migrate | Iterative process of schema and data migration; perform validations. |
|Remediate Applications | Iterative process of making any necessary changes to applications, if any. |
|Perform Tests | Iterative process of funtional and performance testing. |
|Optimize | Post-migration validation and optimization. |
