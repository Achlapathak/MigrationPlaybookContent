<!--Process Overview-->
Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project. A methodology is required for
success. We recommend the below steps for migration project considerations.

Each phase in the process is briefly described as below:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Discover | Inventory of your current database assets and application stack discovery.|
|Assess & Convert | Assess workloads and fix recommedations; schema conversion. |
|Migrate | Iterative process of schema and data migration; perform validations. |
|Remediate Applications | Iterative process of making necessary changes to applications, if any. |
|Perform Tests | Iterative process of execution funtional and performance tests. |
|Optimize | Post-migration validation and optimization. |
|Data Sync | Keep the data sync between source and target. |
|Cutover | Rollback strategy and plans post migration. |
