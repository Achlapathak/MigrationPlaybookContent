<!--Migrate Data-->

When your schema has been successfully migrated to the target, the next step is to execute the data movement. Azure Database Migration 
Service (DMS) can be used to acheive this.

### Steps

To use DMA to create a migration project, perform the following steps.

1. Create a **New Migration** project

    a. Click on the New icon and select “Migration” project type. Select "SQL Server" as source and "Azure SQL Database" as target type. 
    
    b. Choose the "Migration scope" as "Schema only". Click "Create"
