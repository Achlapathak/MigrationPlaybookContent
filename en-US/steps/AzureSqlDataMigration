<!--Migrate Data-->

When your schema has been successfully migrated to the target, the next step is to execute the data movement. Azure Database Migration 
Service (DMS) can be used to acheive this.

### Steps

1. Create an instance of **Azure Database Migration Service**

    a. Log in to the Azure portal, select New, and then search for Azure Database Migration Service.
    
    b. On the Azure data migration service (preview) screen, select Create.
