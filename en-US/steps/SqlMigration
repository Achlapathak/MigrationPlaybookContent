<!-- Migration -->

After assessing your databases, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps - schema migration and data migration.

You can use **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the database, identify potential upgrade blockers, resolve issues, and migrate your schema and data to target SQL platform.

Download the DMA from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595).

* Migrate on-premises SQL Server instance to a modern SQL Server instance hosted on-premises or on an Azure virtual machine accessible from your on-premises network (via VPN or other technologies). 
* Migration workflow helps you migrate the following components: Schema of databases, Data and users, Server roles, SQL and windows logins.
