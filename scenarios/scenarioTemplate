// Let this template be your guide and we'll all be fine.
// Do NOT modify the names of the fields, only modify the values.
// Values must be within "".
// Values are on the right hand side of the ":".
// All values except the last one has to end with a comma after the quotes.

/*	"filelocation"
		- The location of the resource file.
		- The folder name of its type is assumed. So if it's a step do NOT include "step/" as part of the location.
		- You may, however, put files in subfolders and those should be included.
		- You should also not include the ".md" as part of the file.
		Example (correct): A step file called assessment in the steps folder should just be: "assessment".
		Example (correct): A step file called premigration in the subfolder oracle (in the steps folder) would be: "oracle/premigration".
		Example (wrong): "actions/gethelp"
	"actions"
		- Generally small, follow-up items for steps. Because of this, and that they are unique for each step,
		  they are a sub-field of steps. These generally take the form of websites or other online resources.
		  But they are still contained within their own files within the "actions" folder so they need the same
		  filelocation information as steps.
		- "filelocation"
			- This follows the exact same rules and guidelines as the filelocation for steps outlined above.
	"footer"
		- Not currently used but probability of use is high enough that this is left in.
