// Let this template be your guide and we'll all be fine.
// Do NOT modify the names of the fields, only modify the values.

// Values are on the right hand side of the ":".
// All values except the last one has to end with a comma after the quotes.

/*	"sectiontype"
		- The section in which this item belongs. Accepts "B" (for Business) or "T" (for Technical)
	"itemtype"
		- What this item's type is. Accepts "A" (for Action) or "S" (for Step)
	"order"
		- The order in its section it will appear to the user. Accepts a number.
	"filelocation"
		- The location of the resource file.
		- The folder name of its type is assumed. So if it's a step do NOT include "step/" as part of the location.
		- You may, however, put files in subfolders and those should be included.
		- You should also not include the ".md" as part of the file.
		Example (correct): A step file called assessment in the steps folder should just be: "assessment".
		Example (correct): A step file called premigration in the subfolder oracle (in the steps folder) would be: "oracle/premigration".
		Example (wrong): "actions/gethelp"
