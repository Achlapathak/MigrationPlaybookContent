// Let this template be your guide and we'll all be fine.

/*	"text"
		- The text of the question as displayed to the user.
		- If it starts with a $ then it will be passed through to the UI as is, otherwise it will be interpreted as the name of the localized resource string to use.
		Example: "$What is your data source?" will be displayed to the user as "$What is your data source?". This is used for internal previewing only.
		Example: "DataSourceQuestion" will display to the user the localized text of that resource (if it exists). So if the site was viewed in English that might display "What is your data source?" to the user. This has to be used for production.
	"options"
		- The list of options of the question displayed to the user. Same rules apply as in "text".
	"order"
		- The order it will appear to the user. Accepts a number.
		- You don't need to physically order the questions within the file. The code monkeys will make sure that the questions will be listed according to the values here. So if you just wanted to add a question you can simply add it to the end even if that new question should be first. Just make sure to update the value for "order" for all the questions to be correct.
	"required"
		- If the user is required to answer this question or not (if not then it is considered to optional or advanced). Accepts "t" or "f".
